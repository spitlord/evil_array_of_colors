-I'd like to turn the program into some sort of A.I. that decides whether image is
  appealing or not (but first I need to study a lot of things obv). Though, I'm thinking
  that it could calculate some number that considers relation and differences between all
  pixels and also relative rectangulars (partition the image into grid and compare sectors).
  Something like analysis of variation in statistics: considering variation between groups
  and variation within groups...
