Few things to consider:
-We should probably rename variable b (BufferedImage) in Filter class to img. 
  That being more explicit and also rgb has letter b
-The pixel class throws ColorException if a value of argb is less than 0 or more than 255.
  There are two ways I see of dealing with such values:
    1) If value ends up being over 255, just set it to 255, if value is < 0, just set it to 0
    2) For < 0, use absolute value, while for over 255 use (mod 256).
        I like this way in a sense that it gives some variability (for example in AddNoize filter)
-Creating classes like Filter (named FilterA, FilterB, e.g) for better organization (?)

      
Thoughts?
